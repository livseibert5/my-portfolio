      <h3>My Time in Spain</h3>
      <p>The summer after my freshman year of high school I went on a
          Middleburry-Monterey Language Academy immersion trip to
          Granada, Spain. During this month-long program, I was only
          allowed to speak Spanish and went from struggling to speak
          the language to nearly fluent by the end. However, I still
          get made fun of for how America my Spanish accent sounds.
          It was an incredible experience to get to explore another
          language and culture so deeply and Spain has remained one
          of my favorite places to visit ever since. While I haven't
          been able to continue my Spanish studies in college due to
          engineering requirements, I have tried to keep up my skills
          through watching Spanish-language television such as <i>Elite</i>
          and <i>Money Heist</i>.</p>
        
      <h3>Cooking in Quarantine</h3>
      <p>Before quarantine, I was never much of a chef. However, after
          my online classes ended this spring I found myself with a
          lot of extra time on my hands and wanted to learn how to
          cook given that I will be living off campus this fall. At
          school, one of my favorite meals was ordering General Tso's
          Crispy Tofu from a Chinese restaurant, so I decided to try to
          recreate that at home. I prefer tofu over chicken because I
          went vegetarian 5 years ago after watching <i>Food Inc.</i>.
          The recipe turned out super well and is outlined below!</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Press the tofu for about 15 minutes to remove extra liquid.
            Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
        </li>
        <li>In the mean time, mix a tablespoon of sesame oil, a tablespoon
            of soy sauce, a teaspoon of rice wine vinegar, half a teaspoon
            of garlic powder, and half a teaspoon of maple syrup in a bowl.
        </li>
        <li>Cut the tofu into chunks and mix it into the liquid, then
            mix 3 tablespoons of cornstarch in one tablespoon at a time.
        </li>
        <li>Put the tofu on a baking sheet and bake for 30 mins.</li>
        <li>Take the tofu out and put it in a pan over medium heat.
            Pour General Tso's sauce over it and let simmer for 5 mins.
        </li>
      </ol>
