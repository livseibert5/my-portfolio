    <h3>My Time in Spain</h3>
    <h5>26 May, 2020</h5>
    <p>The summer after my freshman year of high school I went on a
        Middleburry-Monterey Language Academy immersion trip to
        Granada, Spain. During this month-long program, I was only
        allowed to speak Spanish and went from struggling to speak
        the language to nearly fluent by the end. It was an incredible
        experience to get to explore another language and culture so
        deeply and Spain has remained one of my favorite places to
        visit ever since. While I haven't been able to continue my
        Spanish studies in college due to engineering requirements,
        I have tried to keep up my skills through watching
        Spanish-language television such as <i>Elite</i>
        and <i>Money Heist</i>.</p>

    <h3>Cooking in Quarantine</h3>
    <h5>24 May, 2020</h5>
    <p>Before quarantine, I was never much of a chef. However, after
        my online classes ended this spring I found myself with a
        lot of extra time on my hands and wanted to learn how to
        cook given that I will be living off campus this fall. At
        school, one of my favorite meals was ordering General Tso's
        Crispy Tofu from a Chinese restaurant, so I decided to try to
        recreate that at home. I prefer tofu over chicken because I
        went vegetarian 5 years ago after watching <i>Food Inc.</i>.
        The recipe turned out super well and is outlined below!</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Press the tofu for about 15 minutes to remove extra liquid.
          Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
      <li>In the mean time, mix a tablespoon of sesame oil, a tablespoon
          of soy sauce, a teaspoon of rice wine vinegar, half a teaspoon
          of garlic powder, and half a teaspoon of maple syrup in a bowl.
      <li>Cut the tofu into chunks and mix it into the liquid, then
          mix 3 tablespoons of cornstarch in one tablespoon at a time.
      <li>Put the tofu on a baking sheet and bake for 30 mins.
      <li>Take the tofu out and put it in a pan over medium heat.
          Pour General Tso's sauce over it and let simmer for 5 mins.
    </ol>
