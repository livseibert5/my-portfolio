      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>My name is Livia Seibert and I am a third-year student at Duke University. 
          I am working towards a double major in Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Science
          with concentrations in Digital Systems and Signal Processing. When I am not studying, I am active
          in Duke's social and pre-professional tech interest organization named Catalyst where I served
          as rush chair this semester. I am also involved in Greek life and am a member of Alpha Phi.</p>
      <p>Outside of my school life, I live in the suburbs of Philadelphia with my parents, 3 siblings, 
          and 2 dogs. I'm the oldest of four girls with a 13 year age gap between me and the youngest.
          Having such a big family is often chaotic but a lot of fun.</p>

      <h3>My Projects</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Integrated Design Challenge - worked in a team of 3 engineers to build a robot that would play
            a modified game of quidditch with other robots. An Arduino controlled a system of sensors that
            included QTIs for path following, an XBee module for wireless communication, an LCD display for
            point monitoring, and a Hall Effect sensor to detect the magnetic snitch.</li>
        <li>Falls Prevention Device - worked with a client and a team of 4 engineering students to develop
            a device to prevent falls amongst senior citizens living in nursing homes. Programmed an Arduino
            to control a system of sensors to detect movement and alert nurses through the call system at a
            fraction of the price of existing solutions.</li>
        <li>Storage App - Hackathon-type progject that used the React JavaScript library and Google Maps API
            to build a user interface for an app that would connect college students to nearby storage spaces</li>
        <li>Children's Hospital of Philadelphia - Used the Python framework Flask to develop a web app for a
            team of data-driven genomics researchers to condense user information from a DNA database into a
            more readable and searchable layout.</li>
        <li>School Magazine - made a web app using Web2Py to make my high school's student magazine virtual.
            Included different interfaces for writers, editors, and viewers so that writers could send their
            work to their editor for review through the app, making it displayable to readers only once
            approved by the editor.</li>
      </ul>
